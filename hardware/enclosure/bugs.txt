v01:
* base plate too thin
* base to board gap too narrow, thick gnd wire doesn't fit
* holes for pico too shallow, inserts don't fit
* it is very tricky to screw on the connector and then solder it, ground is inaccessible
* the hole for bnc connector is too narrow, probably thanks to a droopy bridge. Requires a bit of grinding.
